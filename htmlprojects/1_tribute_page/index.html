              <p class="intro-content">Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor.
                He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of 
                The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely 
                recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p>

                  <h2>Parents And Adoption</h2>
                  <p>Jobs was born to Joanne Schieble (later Joanne Simpson) and Abdulfattah "John" Jandali, two University of Wisconsin graduate students.
                    The couple gave up their unnamed son for adoption. Jobs’ father, Jandali, was a Syrian political science professor. His mother,
                    Schieble, worked as a speech therapist. Shortly after Jobs was placed for adoption, his biological parents married and had
                    another child, Mona Simpson. It was not until Jobs was 27 that he was able to uncover information on his biological parents.
                    As an infant, Jobs was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs and named Steven Paul Jobs. Clara worked as an accountant and Paul was
                    a Coast Guard veteran and machinist.</p>

                  <h2>Early Life</h2>
                  <p>Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California. He lived with his adoptive family in Mountain View, California,
                    within the area that would later become known as Silicon Valley. As a boy, Jobs and his father worked on electronics in the
                    family garage. Paul showed his son how to take apart and reconstruct electronics, a hobby that instilled confidence,
                    tenacity and mechanical prowess in young Jobs.</p>

                  <h2>College And Education</h2>
                  <p>While Jobs was always an intelligent and innovative thinker, his youth was riddled with frustrations over formal schooling. Jobs was a prankster in elementary school due to boredom, and his fourth-grade teacher needed to bribe him to study. Jobs tested so well, however, that administrators wanted to skip him ahead to high school — a proposal that his parents declined.

                    After high school, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Lacking direction, he dropped out of college after six months and spent the next 18 months dropping in on creative classes at the school. Jobs later recounted how one course in calligraphy developed his love of typography.

                  <h2>Wife And Children</h2>
                  <p>
                    Jobs and Laurene Powell married on March 18, 1991. The pair met in the early 1990s at Stanford business school, where Powell was an MBA student. They lived
                    together in Palo Alto, California, with their three children: Reed, Erin, and Eve.

                    Jobs also fathered a daughter, Lisa, with girlfriend Chrisann Brennan in 1978, when he was 23. He denied paternity of his daughter in court documents,
                    claiming he was sterile.
                    Lisa Brennan Jobs later wrote of her childhood and relationship with Jobs in her book Small Fry, published in 2018. In 1980, Lisa wrote, DNA tests
                    revealed that she and Jobs were a match, and he was required to begin making paternity payments to her financially struggling mother. Jobs did not
                    initiate a relationship with his daughter until she was 7 years old. When she was a teenager, Lisa came to live with her father.

                  <h2>Cancer And Death</h2>
                  <p>
                    In 2003, Jobs discovered that he had a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare but operable form of pancreatic cancer. Instead of immediately opting for surgery, Jobs chose to alter his pesco-vegetarian diet while weighing Eastern treatment options.

                    For nine months, Jobs postponed surgery, making Apple's board of directors nervous. Executives feared that shareholders would pull their stock if word got out that their CEO was ill. But in the end, Jobs' confidentiality took precedence over shareholder disclosure.
                    
                    In 2004, Jobs had successful surgery to remove the pancreatic tumor. True to form, in subsequent years Jobs disclosed little about his health.
                    
                    <br><br>Early in 2009, reports circulated about Jobs' weight loss, some predicting his health issues had returned, which included a liver transplant. Jobs responded to these concerns by stating he was dealing with a hormone imbalance. Days later, he went on a six-month leave of absence.
                    
                    
                    In an email message to employees, Jobs said his "health-related issues are more complex" than he thought, then named Tim Cook, Apple’s chief operating officer, as “responsible for Apple's day-today operations."
                    
                    <br><br>After nearly a year out of the spotlight, Jobs delivered a keynote address at an invite-only Apple event on September 9, 2009. He continued to serve as master of ceremonies, which included the unveiling of the iPad, throughout much of 2010.
                    
                    In January 2011, Jobs announced he was going on medical leave. In August, he resigned as CEO of Apple, handing the reins to Cook.
                    Jobs died in Palo Alto on October 5, 2011, after battling pancreatic cancer for nearly a decade. He was 56 years old.
